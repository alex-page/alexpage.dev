> I lead multidisciplinary teams, build communities and create systems with modern technology and thoughtful design. I am obsessed with user experience and write code that connects people to pixels.

I am a front-end development manager at [Shopify](https://shopify.com) leading the [Polaris Design System](https://polaris.shopify.com), building a foundation and community for our experiences. I was the Lead User Experience Engineer on the [Australian Government Design System](https://designsystem.gov.au). I worked in a team to align 1000+ websites over 200+ organisations.
